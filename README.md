The aim of the project was to play around with matplotlib visualizations using the weather data returned from an API called OpenWeatherMap API.


In this example, you'll be creating a Python script to visualize the weather of 500+ cities across the world of varying distance from the equator. 
To accomplish this, you'll be utilizing a [simple Python library](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/citipy), 
the [OpenWeatherMap API](https://openweathermap.org/api), and a little common sense to create a representative model of weather across world cities.
